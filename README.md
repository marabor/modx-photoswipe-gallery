# modx-photoswipe-gallery

Combine MODX Gallery Extra and PhotoSwipe Gallery to create a Gallery Album and when clicked
on a thumb inside the album the picture is shown with PhotoSwipe Gallery.

We need the following to implement that.

    MODX Gallery Extra
    MODX phpThumbOf Extra
    getImageProperties Snippet ↓
    PhotoSwipe Gallery
    photoswipeIntegration Snippet (optional) ↓ 

Before beginning

The first thing to do is installing the MODX Gallery Extra and make sure that at least one album was created and a few pictures were loaded into it. To avoid confusion, give the uploaded images a short description. Any questions? A quick reference for setting up your gallery could be found in the documentation.
